    <h3> Cheap Healthy Easy Recipes </h3>
      <p> Why don’t you sit back for a moment and think. Yes, it’s hard, but cooking your meals is actually much healthier and cheaper than eating out every night. You have control of what you put in--varying amounts of salt to keep that cholesterol in check, or amount of sugar depending on how strong your sweet tooth is.</p>

      <p> Look, we didn’t lump you together with the vegans! We’re not dumb!</p>
      <p> As a vegetarian, it’s sometimes hard to get enough protein so we’re going to provide you with some meat substitutes </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Beans are magical. They’re cheap--perfect for your perpetually empty wallet--healthy, and filling. Not only that, but you can use them in a variety of meals from soups to salads to even burgers.</li>
        <li> Cauliflower. You’ve probably heard of this one before. If not, well cauliflower can be used to substitute for chicken, steak, and gluten! Check out how to cook them just right: <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/19/paleo-recipes-with-cauliflower-delish_n_5689172.html" target="_blank"> https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/19/paleo-recipes-with-cauliflower-delish_n_5689172.html </a> </li>
      </ul>

        <p> As a vegan, it’s also hard to get your daily dose of protein. But don’t worry, nuts have you covered! Nuts are pretty filling, so they make good meat substitutes. Use them to make a burger or even cheese substitutes.</p>
        <p> Potatoes can be used to make desserts. Yep, you read that right. Read all about it here: <a href = "http://www.onegreenplanet.org/vegan-food/recipe-chocolate-potato-cake/" target="_blank"> http://www.onegreenplanet.org/vegan-food/recipe-chocolate-potato-cake/ </a> </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Cutting onions that are chilled won’t cause you to tear up as much </li>
        <li>Brine (salt water with herbs and spices) your meat before cooking it to ensure it doesn’t dry out </li>
        <li>Use pineapple juice to tenderize your meat! For those science nerds out there, it contains the enzyme bromelain, which acts as a natural tenderizer. Make sure it’s fresh pineapple juice, because the canned version doesn’t contain bromelain</li>
        <li>Don’t throw away your chicken scraps--you can use the bones to create broth that can be used in soup or something else </li>
        <li>Double bag your bread before you put it in your freezer so it’ll last longer</li>
        <li>If your cheese is moldy, cut off the mold and the rest will be perfectly safe to eat</li>
        <li>You can freeze your vegetables for up to a year after being cut (depends on the vegetable)</li>
        <li>Leave an open container of baking soda in the fridge to remove odors</li>
        <li>Keep the avocado pit in your guacamole to keep it fresh and prevent it from turning brown</li>
      </ul>
