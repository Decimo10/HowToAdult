<li>  One of the first things interviewers see when you walk through the door is
  how you present yourself. Looks can make or break your first impression.
   This might have you worried, but don’t sweat it, we’ve got you covered.
     <li> First, make sure you know how to dress. Is it business casual or
        business formal? But if you don’t know the dress code,
        you can never be too professional.

<li>Another important tip about presentation is eye-contact. Never look away.
  Ever. Then, when you shake hands, match the strength of the person shaking
  your hand--you don’t want your handshake to be like a dead fish or a
  crushing claw. This might take a bit of practice, so find a friend or family
   member to help you out.</li>
   <li>During the actual interview, stay away from slang terms.
     Always make you language coherent and professional. And keep eye-contact!</li>
      </ul>

      <p> Start early, good companies will fill up because everyone wants
         to work there--there is no such thing as being too young, or having too
          little experience!</p>
          <p>Never discourage yourself--everyone with a job starts off without
             a job. Always practice your elevator pitch, also known as a one
             to two minute description of yourself and interests. The recruiter
              at a career fair has a long line of people to get through, so
               you want to make sure you stand out. Say what you are interested
                in - this will help them place you. If there's a good candidate
                 match, it makes the change of the itern returning for another
                  internship. Always follow-up with your recruiter. Use a
                   resume, get their email. Send them a follow up saying
                    “We met at the career fair a few days ago. I really
                    excited to learn more about what you’re doing in the future.
                     I’d like to stay in touch if any new opportunities arise.</p>

      <p> Make sure your resume is peer-reviewed by friends and family
         to make sure you don’t have typos. Present your best self--leadership
          positions, awards, past relevant experience, past relevant classes,
           research experience, and involvement in the community. Section
            at bottom for relevant skill (for CS, it’d be language, web
            development, etc). Can include an objective statement
             “I’m a freshman, seeking to get an internship to develop my
              skills in…,” but this isn’t necessary. If you’re a freshman with
              a sparse resume, you could include it to fill up space. But as
               a senior, definitely cut it out because it’s akin to the first
               lines you say to a recruiter in person. Be honest,
               never lie about the experience you have, and never lie about
                the companies you’ve worked for! Many of you may be worried
                 about your GPA. Don’t worry, some companies don’t outright ask
                  for GPA, although some do. But a lower GPA can be offset by
                  other things, like a part-time internship or a research project</p>
