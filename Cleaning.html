    <p align="center"> You will need: dirty laundry, laundry detergent (or PODS but not for eating),
       money (quarters or card) - this stuff isn’t free </p>
       <h4> Steps: </h4>
       <ol type="1">
          <li> Sort your laundry. Usually, the rule of thumb is to sort your heavy (dark) and light
             colors and like color clothes separately. - or if you don’t care, just put everything
              in the same load.... You should also wait to do laundry when you have a full load and not do half loads.</li>
                    <li> How much detergent should you use? If you use PODS, just use one per load
                      - DO NOT EAT! If you are using regular liquid, use the top cap as your measuring cup
                      and follow the directions on the bottle. If you are ever in doubt, less is better here -
                      where using less liquid detergent is ok, will still get your clothes clean, and will
                      save you from going through liquid detergent as fast. </li>
                      <li> Using the washing machine - the dials may be confusing - but they are used
                        to determine how much water should be filled and how long it should wash for. </li>
                        <li> Make a timer for when to switch your loads (or your wet laundry
                           might be sitting on the gross table when you come find it. </li>
                           <li> Either air dry or move all your wet laundry to the dryer - it also costs money. </li>
                         </ol>

      <p> It is very easy for the bathroom to get disgusting - especially
        if you are not the only one using it. The first thing to do when cleaning a
         bathroom is to maintain it - which means a regular schedule for cleaning it.
         This could be once a week, every other week, etc.  </p>
<p> Now to the cleaning part. The three main parts of a bathroom are: the sink, the toilet, the shower. (just in case you didn’t know).</p>

<h4 align="center"> The Sink </h4>
<p> If you are having trouble getting your sink to drain properly, pour white vinegar
   or baking soda down the drain and flush with hot water. For the faucet, you can just
   use vinegar and a towel to scrub down the faucet and handles. </p>

   <h4 align="center"> The Toilet </h4>
     <p> Toilet - There are a ton of different products that you can buy from the store to clean the toilet.
        But an easy and cheaper option is to just pour a cup of baking soda in your toilet bowl, scrub, and flush. </p>
<p> TIP: Many of the cleaning products contain very harmful chemicals that are bad for the environment
   (so another good reason for the baking soda option).</p>
        <h4 align="center"> The Shower </h4>
        <p>  The water minerals and soap scum over time will build up in your tub and can be pretty disgusting.
           A pretty easy hack that you can do is dip a cloth in some white vinegar and scrub your tub. Also,
           if your shower head starts to get clogged, you can fill a bag full of white vinegar to get
            the shower head to function better. </p>

      <p> First thing to do when you have just gotten a stain - on clothing or carpet/fabric -
        Put water on the stain <b>immediately</b> - and do not scrub but <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/lae7QSMFxEkkE/giphy.gif " target="_blank"></a>. Water works on most things -
         pretty universal.Detergent, vinegar, lemon juice, salt are other solvents that you can use for specific stains.</p>

      <p> “DO NOT INGEST” </p>
      <p>If your washing machine does not have a bleach dispenser: mix the water in the washing machine with detergent
        and bleach then put clothes in - not before. If your washing machine has a bleach dispenser: pour bleach
        into bleach dispenser until full. </p>
