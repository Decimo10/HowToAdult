      <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="https://fthmb.tqn.com/7QlO8qCFoiqAMBGiarbNq9bJ4Mc=/768x0/filters:no_upscale()/SampleCompletedCheck-5a0b762547c26600371b012b.png" style="width:500px;height:275px;">
        <p> Ever looked at a blank check and wondered where to start? Well, it’s always safe to start with the date--in the top right corner, just fill out the current date and you’re good! Next, you’ll want to write the name of the person/company of whoever you’re paying. This will be on the line “Pay to the order of.”</p>
        <p> After that, things get a little more complicated. In the box with the dollar sign to its left, write the numerical form of the amount you’re paying. But be warned! You must leave no empty space in this box, or else someone could get ahold of your check and add extra zeros that you’ll no doubt not remember writing. To make sure this doesn’t happen, put a squiggly line through the empty space. On the line below, you’ll write the amount of money in words and again you’ll want to draw a squiggly through the empty space. It’s better to be safe than sorry! </p>
        <p> Next, don’t forget to sign the check! Unfortunately you can’t use nicknames. You must use the name that your bank has under file for you.</p>
        <p> To finish off, the line that reads “Memo” is completely optional. It’s pretty much meant to remind whomever you’re paying what the check is for--be it the bill to a roofing company for a patched leak or a check to a relative as a birthday gift. </p>
        <p> Finally (and we bet you were thinking that you were done after the memo or signature) make sure you keep a record of the checks you write. This is very simple and easy: have a check register on hand to help you keep track of all your payments. This helps to prevent you from paying the same person or company twice, and also serves as a reference for if a check gets lost or stolen. </p>

      <h3> B U D G E T I N G </h3>
        <p> That’s right. You just spent $30 on Starbucks frappuccinos this past week, you’re feeling a little (or very) guilty, and now you’re here. Luckily for you, we have some tips and tricks so that you don’t have to live off of instant ramen for four years.</p>
        <p> Be realistic. Don’t limit your spending in a way that doesn’t reasonably work with your lifestyle. For example, $2 a day on food isn’t realistic. Neither is $30 a week on frappuccinos.</p>
        <p> Differentiate between needs and wants. Contrary to popular belief, Pokemon Ultra Sun and Moon are wants, not needs. While, you may really want the latest video games or Adidas sneakers, you can live without them. It’s not always easy, but you can do it. We believe in you.</p>
        <p> Organize your bills and receipts. That’s right. Don’t throw those scraps of paper away just yet. Tossing them in the trash doesn’t make the fact that you regularly spend $10 a week on Ben and Jerry’s go away (college is hard but diabetes is not the solution). Keep track of how much you spend either on an app or notebook, so you can visually see your spending habits. It’s not always pretty, but it’s definitely helpful. </p>
        <p> Look at the big picture. Would you rather eat out every other night or save that money for that study abroad trip you so badly wanted to attend? Whenever you spend extraneously, keep your long and short term goals in mind and organize your spending habits in a way that will help you achieve those goals.</p>

      <h3> C R E D I T </h3>
        <p> If you pay your bills on time, you get a better credit score. Why is this important you ask? Future landlords often ask for your credit score to see whether or not you can pay your bills, and future employers use them as a way of measuring your trustworthiness. </p>
        <p> There’s a general range for each credit score tier, so keep those in mind when checking your credit score. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Excellent Credit: 750+ </li>
          <li> Good Credit: 700-749 </li>
          <li> Fair Credit: 650-699 </li>
          <li> Poor Credit: 600-649 </li>
          <li> Bad Credit: below 600 </li>
        </ul>
        <p> Don't know your credit score? You can check it here: <a href="https://www.creditkarma.com/" target="_blank"> https://www.creditkarma.com/</a>. Just follow the steps on the website to create an account. And don’t worry, this isn’t the only website available. There are plenty others out there!</p>

      <h3> B A N K  &nbsp A C C O U N T S </h3>
        <p> Making a bank account. Yes, it’s very confusing, this process. It seems like there’s so many to choose from! And then weighing the costs and benefits of each can be quite tiring. As a college student, there’s really only two important ones, let’s forget about the rest. Here are the essentials:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> <b> Checking Accounts </b> </li>
            <ul>
              <li> Opening a checking account is a good place to start if you haven’t done so already. These are used to store the money you use for writing checks as well as sending or receiving direct deposits. If you didn’t know, a direct deposit is a form of electronic, online banking. Think of it as an electronic check. These are becoming extremely popular as the use of online banking increases. Use a checking account to make payments--you can link a debit card or credit card.</li>
              <li> Be warned: checking accounts require a minimum balance at all times. Otherwise, you’ll be charged a monthly fee, which you definitely do not want to pay. BUT as long as you’re a college student, don’t worry. Checking accounts will have either low to no monthly fee. Just don’t forget that this will be lifted once you’re an adult (which you’ll hopefully be by the time you’ve read every page on this website).</li>
            </ul>
          <li> <b> Savings Accounts </b> </li>
          <ul>
            <li> As its name suggests, savings accounts are for saving money, or storing it. In fact, there are only so many time you can withdraw money from a savings account. Furthermore, interest rates are usually much higher compared to those of checking accounts, which is definitely a plus! </li>
            <li> If you’re still confused, (and don’t worry, it’s alright) just head over to your bank and talk it through. There will be plenty of people there to lay it out for you, which is probably for the best because each bank might offer different benefits, interest rates, and credit rewards depending on your plan and type of account. </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
