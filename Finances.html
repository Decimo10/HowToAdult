      <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="https://fthmb.tqn.com/7QlO8qCFoiqAMBGiarbNq9bJ4Mc=/768x0/filters:no_upscale()/SampleCompletedCheck-5a0b762547c26600371b012b.png">
        <p> Ever looked at a blank check and wondered where to start? Well, it’s always safe to start with the date--in the top right corner, just fill out the current date and you’re good! Next, you’ll want to write the name of the person/company of whoever you’re paying. This will be on the line “Pay to the order of.”</p>
        <p> After that, things get a little more complicated. In the box with the dollar sign to its left, write the numerical form of the amount you’re paying. But be warned! You must leave no empty space in this box, or else someone could get ahold of your check and add extra zeros that you’ll no doubt not remember writing. To make sure this doesn’t happen, put a squiggly line through the empty space. On the line below, you’ll write the amount of money in words and again you’ll want to draw a squiggly through the empty space. It’s better to be safe than sorry! </p>
        <p> Next, don’t forget to sign the check! Unfortunately you can’t use nicknames. You must use the name that your bank has under file for you.</p>
        <p> To finish off, the line that reads “Memo” is completely optional. It’s pretty much meant to remind whomever you’re paying what the check is for--be it the bill to a roofing company for a patched leak or a check to a relative as a birthday gift. </p>
        <p> Finally (and we bet you were thinking that you were done after the memo or signature) make sure you keep a record of the checks you write. This is very simple and easy: have a check register on hand to help you keep track of all your payments. This helps to prevent you from paying the same person or company twice, and also serves as a reference for if a check gets lost or stolen. </p>

        <p> That’s right. You just spent $30 on Starbucks frappuccinos this past week, you’re feeling a little (or very) guilty, and now you’re here. Luckily for you, we have some tips and tricks so that you don’t have to live off of instant ramen for four years.</p>
        <p> Be realistic. Don’t limit your spending in a way that doesn’t reasonably work with your lifestyle. For example, $2 a day on food isn’t realistic. Neither is $30 a week on frappuccinos.</p>
        <p> Differentiate between needs and wants. Contrary to popular belief, Pokemon Ultra Sun and Moon are wants, not needs. While, you may really want the latest video games or Adidas sneakers, you can live without them. It’s not always easy, but you can do it. We believe in you.</p>
        <p> Organize your bills and receipts. That’s right. Don’t throw those scraps of paper away just yet. Tossing them in the trash doesn’t make the fact that you regularly spend $10 a week on Ben and Jerry’s go away (college is hard but diabetes is not the solution). Keep track of how much you spend either on an app or notebook, so you can visually see your spending habits. It’s not always pretty, but it’s definitely helpful. </p>
        <p> Look at the big picture. Would you rather eat out every other night or save that money for that study abroad trip you so badly wanted to attend? Whenever you spend extraneously, keep your long and short term goals in mind and organize your spending habits in a way that will help you achieve those goals.</p>
