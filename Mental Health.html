    <h3> Y O U &nbsp M A T T E R </h3>
      <p> These days it seems like time passes by so quickly. Blink, and it feels like you missed out on a memory, an event, an opportunity. Amidst this rapid whirlwind called life, it’s easy to forget to take care of yourself. Take some time everyday to focus on yourself. Put away your homework, treat yourself to your favorite food, and pull up your favorite TV show. Remember that you matter, and that there are people in this crazy mess of a world who care about you. If no one comes to mind, at least know that we care (we made this website for a reason).</p>
    <h3> I T ' S &nbsp A - O K A Y </h3>
      <p>College probably hasn’t been what you expected it to be. It never is for anyone. We make plans that don’t always get carried out and unexpected events come our way. Life isn’t meant to be perfect, and it’s okay to mess up. What’s important is to know that a couple slip-ups don’t mean the end of the world. When you fall, it’s okay to sit down and recover, but always remember that it’s possible to get back up and live again. It’s okay. You will be okay. </p>
